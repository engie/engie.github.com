<p>I'm in the shiny new Academy of Chinese Language Study, about to start an 8 week course of beginners Mandarin with World Link Education. After 20 hours travel, moving in with my delightful host family (Mr, &amp; Mrs. Tien, the most grandparenty people I've ever met) and being introduced to the facilities available to me as a student here I'm ready to go.</p>
<p>As I'm still on UK time I didn't sleep last night - at 6 I gave up and went for a stroll. Beijing was wide awake, from the group of 40 pensioners doing early morning Tai Chi in the park to the crowds of traffic careering through the streets.</p>
<p>There are a small set of photos on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/stephenenglish/sets/72157606024351194/">Flickr</a>. I will upload more as I take them.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6550447907550133610-5334637417340819168?l=www.secomputing.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
