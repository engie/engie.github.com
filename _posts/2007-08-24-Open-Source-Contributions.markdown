I've dispatched a couple of patches recently:
<h2>rt73 Driver</h2><p>This summer I've been working with the lovely folks at <a href="http://www.roke.co.uk/">Roke Manor Research</a>. I am looking at the throughput of multihop adhoc networks, and we're using a network of machines with rt73 based wireless adapters (the Edimax 54 Mbps Wireless USB stick with Antenna from <a href="http://www.linuxemporium.co.uk/products/wireless/">http://www.linuxemporium.co.uk/products/wireless/</a>). These have a bug in the bit of code that merges an adhoc network. Imagine 2 laptops, Lappy &amp; Dappy</p><p>Lappy: hmm, wouldn't now be a nice time to announce to the world that I'm here so they know they can connect to me...</p><p>Lappy: BEACON FRAME!!! HELLOOO!!! I'm here on a network called ADHOC and the network id (BSSID) is... 42*
</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">What Should Happen</span></p><p>Dappy: Ooh! What's that I hear? A beacon frame for a network called ADHOC? I'm on a network called ADHOC! Why don't we merge and form one big happy adhoc family.</p><p>Dappy: The thing is, what BSSID should we give this new family...</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Dappy: His BSSID is 42, mine is 35. 42 is bigger than 35 so he wins - I'll change to 42 and tell everyone that I'm now on the network with an ID of 42.</p><p>Dappy: BEACON FRAME!!! HI THERE! I'm on a network called ADHOC still, but now the BSSID is 42</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">What Actually Happens</span></p><p>Dappy: BEACON FRAME!!! HI THERE! I'm on a network called ADHOC still, my BSSID is 35
</p><p>Dappy: What's this? A beacon from Lappy? He's got a BSSID of 42? That's higher than mine at 35, I better change.</p><p>Lappy: What's this? A beacon from Dappy? He's got a BSSID of 35. That's higher than mine at 42 (D'OH! ed), I better change.
</p><p>Lappy: BEACON FRAME!!! HELLOOO!!! I'm here on a network called ADHOC and the BSSID is 35</p><p>Dappy: BEACON FRAME!!! SALUT! I'm on a network called ADHOC and my BSSID is 42.</p><p>Dappy: What's this? A beacon from Lappy? He's got a BSSID of 35? That's higher than mine at 42, I better change.</p> <p>Lappy: What's this? A beacon from Dappy? He's got a BSSID of 42. That's higher than mine at 35, I better change.
</p> <p>Lappy: BEACON FRAME!!! HELLOOO!!! I'm here on a network called ADHOC and the BSSID is 42</p> <p>Dappy: BEACON FRAME!!! SALUT! I'm on a network called ADHOC and my BSSID is 35.</p><p>etc etc etc...
</p><p>This repeats forever. Yay. My patch fixes the which-number-is-bigger algorithm. It's not a big patch.
</p><p><em>*Direct quote. True story.</em></p><h2>woof</h2><p><a href="http://www.home.unix-ag.org/simon/woof.html">woof</a> is a great little utility for sharing files across a network. It creates a little web server just for that one file, and anyone can download from it. I use it loads for moving files (or directories - it tar.gz compresses them), particularly from linux to windows boxes.</p><p>I patched it to allow the whole thing to go backwards - you run woof on one machine and it starts serving a webpage with a simple form on it. You can then go to that form from another machine, do a normal file-upload thing and hit submit. The file is then sent to the machine running woof, which saves it.
