title: Student Robotics Simulator
---
I have developed a simulator for the <a href="http://www.studentrobotics.org/">Student Robotics project</a>. The students in this competition have to build robots that drive themselves around an arena, collecting coloured tokens. To allow them to practice programming their robots before they have got a working one, I wrote the simulator.

The simulator is written in Python. It uses the wonderful <a href="http://www.ode.org/">ODE</a> physics engine to figure out what effect the robot will have on its environment, and draws the scene with <a href="http://www.pygame.org">pygame</a>.

Here is a brief screencast in which I quickly explain how to use the simulator:
