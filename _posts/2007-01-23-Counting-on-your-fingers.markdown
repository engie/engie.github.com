title: Counting on your fingers...
---
Jeff, our resident genius here at Southampton University, just pointed out to me something I had overlooked all of my life. By utilising the position information inherent in your fingers (they are in a set order), you can use them to represent binary digits. As you have 10 fingers this means you can count from 0 to 2^10 - 1, 1023, ON YOUR FINGERS!!!

Previously I had only been able to count up to 10, so Jeff has increased my counting capacity by a factor of 100!

This is, by far, the most important thing I have learnt all year. Please, tell your friends. Pass on the joy.

P.S. by bringing your toes into the mix, you can count to 2^20 - 1 = 1048575!!!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6550447907550133610-9157180462321854244?l=www.secomputing.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
