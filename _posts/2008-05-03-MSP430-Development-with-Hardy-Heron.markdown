title: MSP430 Development with Hardy Heron
---
In order to get started with developing for as MSP430 microcontroller I needed to build a range of specific versions of the mspgcc components accorging to the <a href="http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net/manual/c1685.html">build instructions</a>.

I have distilled these into a single script that should grab all the necessary code, build them and then install them into the current directory. - Get it <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/secomputing.co.uk/code/Home/download-msp430?attredirects=0">here</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6550447907550133610-4113903330045902073?l=www.secomputing.co.uk' alt='' /></div>
